# Description
Link your socials, wallet addresses and payment methods all in one place - stellfi.me

Cryptocurrency payment methods are often complex and not optimally used for casual payments. identity and payments are usually provided on a 'just in time' basis, as users generally have multiple accounts for both wallets and socials.

# How we built it
stellfi.me implementation loves JS with web3 techs (Rust and soroban sdk)

A MongoDB is used to store the socials, wallets, & profiles.

Since our app relies on an infrastructure of integrating social medias & crypto, we have used freighter for payments and storage system of soroban
